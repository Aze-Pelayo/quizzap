# About
Quizzap is a quiz application built with React. For this application, I used the following to build it:
- React.js
- Sass
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
- Figma
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/)
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/0b0a0a-f3f8f2-3581b8-fcb07e-dee2d6)

The live version is [here](https://azriellep.github.io/quizzap/).

## Future Plans
I plan to get the quiz data from an API instead of saving it on a separate file. My current option is the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php), although it's limited to only one category per API call. I also plan to include a progress bar and a timer inside the Quiz child component to make it more challenging and interesting. Additionally, the Results child component lacks design and content, so I'm planning to include animations and/or transitions and SVGs for it.
